  <p>If you’re a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, you will probably be familiar with Pai Sho.  It’s a fictional game that constantly makes an appearance in this animated series.  Although there are no official rules for Pai Sho, there are <a href="https://skudpaisho.com/site/games/">many community driven ones</a>.  I recently picked up this extra small <a href="https://baronalbatross.company.site/products/Pai-Sho-XXS-Game-Kit-p354041377">DIY Pai Sho kit</a>.  The kit contains all the pieces needed to assembly a board.  The tiles (tokens) included are for one of the more popular fan made games called “Skud Pai Sho”.  Putting it together wasn’t too difficult, but a utility knife is definitely needed to cut out all the board parts.</p>

<p>Once I glued the board together, I decided to wood burn the sections.  In Pai Sho, the sections are called “gardens”.  Unfortunately, I got glue all over the board.  In addition, I was off a little bit so there were some gaps in the middle as a result.  If you decide to try this kit, definitely take the time to measure everything out on this step.</p>

<p>For the pieces, I used coffee to stain them and then put a layer of Mod Podge Dimensional
Magic on top.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I would recommend using the Mod Podge Dimensional Magic because some of the coats came out cloudy.  I don’t know if I just put on too much or if that is just the nature of the product.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I was still quite pleased with how everything turned out.  This is a tiny board to play on which makes it’s idea for taking on the go.  The compact size also makes it a low time investment as DIY projects go.  Now it’s time for a cup of tea and a game of Pai Sho.</p>
