        Do-It-Yourself: Casting a Resin King
      </a>
    </h1>

    <p>One of the many enduring qualities of tafl games is the simplicity of the pieces.   No matter what size board or what rule variation (with perhaps the exception of <a href="http://aagenielsen.dk/berserk_rules.php">Berserk Hnefatafl</a>), a set only need pieces of 3 distinctions: attackers, defenders and a king.  This makes it easier to create your own set.  It is common to see decorative glass gems as hnefatafl pieces.  In the <a href="http://www.richgames.xyz/2016/10/24/diy-brandub/">last post</a>, we started to make a <a href="http://www.richgames.xyz/2016/09/18/basic-brandub/">Basic Brandub</a> game with these.  Let’s upgrade the set a bit with a hand-casted resin king piece.</p>

<p>Tucked away in a drawer, I had an old chess pawn given to me by my best friend in grade school.  I’ve had this pawn since I was 7 or 8 years old.  It reminds me of my first friendship and being that tafl games are great to play with friends, it was a fitting piece to cast.  Obviously, pick an item that works for you and give your set a personal touch.</p>

<p>Using a <a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/products/oomoo-30/">silicone mold making kit</a>, I carefully follow the instructions and made a mold of the chess pawn.  This stuff is messy and gooey, so be sure to wear gloves and cover the work area with newspapers.  The mold takes about 6 hours to cure, so be patient.  It took a few tries to get it right, but the result was a durable mold I can use over and over again.</p>

<p>There are many types of resin to choose from.  <a href="http://www.alumilite.com/store/p/934-Alumilite-White-Amazing-Casting-Resin.aspx">Alumilite makes a fast curing, beginner friendly resin</a> that works great for small pieces.  Like the mold making kit, it’s important to follow the instructions carefully and use gloves while casting the piece.</p>

<p>After about 20 minutes, I had a perfect copy of my original chess pawn that makes a great king piece in the <a href="/2016/09/18/basic-brandub/">Basic Brandub</a> set.</p>

<p>One game’s pawn is another game’s king. Such is life.</p>
