        Some Quick Thoughts on Hnefatafl by Jonathon George
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2022-11-07T00:00:00-08:00" class="post-date">07 Nov 2022</time>

    <p>In August of 2019, I posted this tweet:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/hnefatafl-book-tweet-2019.png" alt="Hnefatafl Book Tweet" /></p>

<p>Fast forward 3 years, I finally take a crack at reading book.
Since I literally just finished it tonight, I’d thought I jot down some quick
thoughts while the ideas were still fresh in my head.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At 437 pages, this is a very long and comprehensive book.</li>
  <li>It’s probably a little too long.</li>
  <li>I really appreciate the passion Jonathon George has for Hnefatafl.  You really can sense that while reading this book.</li>
  <li>I think he struggled a little to find a consistent voice for the book.  Sometimes it wanted to be more academic, sometimes it wanted to be more casual and conversational.</li>
  <li>I wish there was more of a deep dive analysis on Alea Evangelii.</li>
  <li>I really liked how there were different sets of rules presented at the end.</li>
  <li>I also really liked how he gave rules for other related games as well.</li>
  <li>I would not recommend to someone just wanting to learn casually about the game.
Damian Walker’s books are probably better for that.</li>
  <li>I would recommend to someone who wants a different perspective and is especially interested in the ancient folklores, poems and story related to the game.</li>
</ul>
